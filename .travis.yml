##### Matrix definition
# For C++ projects, the env, compiler and os (provided as arrays)
# multiply to construct the build matrix. The shallow (refer to 
# excluded configurations) resulting matrix yields 6 jobs:
# - linux:
#   - gcc:   Debug and Release over Qt4 
#   - clang: Debug and Release over Qt4
# - osx:
#   - clang: Debug and Release over Qt4 and Qt5
#     NOTE: under the hood OSX does in fact two sub-jobs per job,
#           since two Qt versions 4 and 5 are sequentially tested.
# - Win32:  (not dealt with by Travis bu through Appveyor)
#   - VC++: Debug and Release over Qt4 and Qt5

os:
  - linux      # Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr
  - osx        # Default is OSX 10.9 (2013). Other versions are
               # available, including OSX 10.11 (2015), refer to
               # https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/osx-ci-environment/ 

compiler:
  - gcc
  - clang      # Under OSX the backend is Apple's LLVM

env:
  - BTYPE="-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug   -DBUILD_ALL_PLUGINS=ON"
