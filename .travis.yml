# For C++ projects, the env, compiler and os (provided as arrays)
# multiply to construct the build matrix. The shallow (refer to
# excluded configurations) resulting matrix yields 6 jobs:
# - linux:
#   - gcc:   Debug and Release over Qt4
#   - clang: Debug and Release over Qt4
# - osx:
#   - clang: Debug and Release over Qt4 and Qt5
#     NOTE: under the hood OSX does in fact two sub-jobs per job,
#           since two Qt versions 4 and 5 are sequentially tested.
# - Win32:  (not dealt with by Travis bu through Appveyor)
#   - VC++: Debug and Release over Qt4 and Qt5

  ### OSX dependencies install:
  - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" == "osx" ]]; then
      brew update; fi
    # Dealing with boost on OSX is messy. The difficulty is for cmake to
    # find (when using find_package()) its boost required dependency:
    #   - sometimes it will find it under the Boost name (capital B to Boost
    #     it works for other paltforms)
    #   - sometimes it will find it under the boost name (lower case b to boost)
    #     which is very OSX specific.
    # The additional difficulty is that this Boost vs boost confusiong depends
    # (still for OSX) on a combination of two parameters:
    #  - cmake version number,
    #  - boost packages version number.
    # In order to illustrate this difficulty, the follwing table illustrates
    # the "fluctations" encountered in the history of the platform
    #                  |  3.4.1  |  3.4.3  |  3.7.1  | CMake version
    #    ---------------------------------------------
    #      < 1.60      |  Boost  |  boost  |         |
    #        1.62      |         |         |  Boost  |
    #        1.63      |         |         |  boost  |
    #    ---------------------------------------------
    #    Boost version |
    # In other terms, with cmake version smaller to 3.4.1 you had to find
    # "Boost". Then when cmake came to version 3.4.1 you had to find the
    # lower case version "boost". When cmake upgraded to 3.7.1 one has to
    # fold back to a capital "Boost". But when boost package changed from
    # 1.62 to 1.63, one had to use the small caps "boost" again.
    # This succession of situations becomes hellish when you know that Travis
    # upgrades (that impact on OSX version that impacts on brew version)
    # are decoralated from Homebrew upgrade choices for the current
    # cmake version vs boost version...
    #
    # This would be already chanlenging to maintain if another tranversal
    # difficulty (due to Travis) didn't kick in: sometimes when Travis
    # instals boost directly (through "brew install boost") then brew triggers
    # a re-install that ends up considered as an (false positive) error by
    # Travis. A work around (documented here
    #  https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/osx-ci-environment/#A-note-on-upgrading-packages )
    # consists in using the following odd form or install:
    #      brew outdated boost || brew upgrade boost; fi
    # All the above histoty is to say that, when installing boost for OSX on
    # Travis, you can expect some unstability and time (version dependent)
    # kludgy (ad-hoc) fixes. Here goes the historical notes:
    #   Prior to 2017 we upgraded boost (to obtain version 1.62) which
    #   made "Boost" available (OSX would behave as the other platforms again):
    #   - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" == "osx" ]]; then
    #      brew outdated boost || brew upgrade boost; fi
    #   As for January 2017, upgrading boost would switch to version 1.63
    #   which means switching from Boost to boost again (refer to the above
    # table). So we choose _not_ to upgrade and stick with version the
    # default provided version 1.62...
  - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" == "osx" ]]; then
       brew info boost; fi
    # As of december 2016, Homebrew no longer offers qt (qt4): refer to
    #    https://github.com/cartr/homebrew-qt4/issues/5
  - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" == "osx" ]]; then

    ### Open-Scene-Graph
    # Travis feeds on Homebrew that switched its default version of OSG to
    # be 3.5.5 (which seems not even official, refer to
    # http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/download-section/developer-releases).
    # This breaks the embarked version 34 of OSG-QT. We thus trick Homebrew to
    # install version 3.4.4 by overwriting the associated formula. This must be
    # done just before installing OSG since Homebrew default behavior is now to
    # check for updates on a per command basis a.k.a. auto-update (e.g. each
    # time a sub-dependency is installed) and thus in order to prevent any
    # change (overwrite to 3.5.5) that could happen (within the Homebrew
    # repository) in between the "brew update" and the following "brew
    # install" of OSG:
  - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" == "osx" ]]; then brew update; fi
  - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" == "osx" ]]; then
      cd /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula  &&

    ### Gdal
    # "brew install gdal" is skipped because was already (indirectly) pulled.
    # Yet we need to fix an unstatified dependency of libgdal.1.dylib that
    # looks for libspatialite.5.dylib (version 5) when the libspatialite
    # formula installs libspatialite.7.dylib (version 7). We thus trick
    # libgdal in getting what it needs:

    # letting them be pulled indirectly by pcl) just to make sub-dependencies
    # more explicit.

    # Flann depends on gcc-7.2.x that fails on install, refer to

    # Pcl itself takes a long time to be poured (more than Travis's 10'
    # default cut off). Note that using brew options like --without-apps
    # or --without-tools triggers a pull of sources and a rebuild which is
